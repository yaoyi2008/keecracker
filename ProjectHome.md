KeeCracker is a KeePass 2 database cracker. It runs from the command-line and attempts to guess the KeePass database password as rapidly as possible using the dictionary you provide.

KeeCracker requires a dictionary. The dictionary is simply a list of passwords to try on the database. A dictionary can be downloaded online, or generated automatically using a password generator.

KeeCracker is written in .NET, but it uses native DLLs to greatly increase performance. These native binaries currently only exist for Windows. Therefore, it is not recommended to run KeeCracker in other operating systems.

If you have experience using John the Ripper or similar utilities, KeeCracker will be fairly self-explanatory. A great [tutorial](http://www.excivity.com/ComputeCycle/cracking-keepass-passwords/) has also been written on using KeeCracker.
